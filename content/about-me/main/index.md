I'm Ghassane Benmir and I am a PhD candidate and a teaching fellow at both the LSE and PSL Research. 

My research interests span macro-finance and climate change. I will be in the job market next December 2022.

Prior to joining the LSE, I worked as a senior advisor for top consultancy firms and industry, advising governments and private sector actors in various countries for their strategic engagements.
