description: I am a researcher and teaching fellow at the London School of Economics and Political Science (LSE) and Paris Sciences et Lettres University (PSL Research). My research explores linkages between macroeconomic theory and heterogeneity, asset pricing theory, climate change, and distributional impacts of both environmental externalities and policy. Prior to joining the LSE, I worked as a senior advisor for top consultancy firms and industry, advising governments and private sector actors in various countries for their strategic engagements.
